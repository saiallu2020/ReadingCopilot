If  these  export  controls  targeting  semiconductors \nassociated  with  AI  including  GPUs  and  associated  products  and  services  are  further  tightened,  our  ability  to \nexport our technology, products or services could be further restricted. We may be at a competitive disadvantage \nif our competitors are not subject to the same or similar restrictions. Additionally, such export controls have, and \nmay  in  the  future,  subject  downstream  recipients  of  our  products  to  additional  restrictions  on  the  use,  resale, \nrepair or transfer of our products and may have a material adverse effect on us.",
